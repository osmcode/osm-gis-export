#  Disabled checks:
#
#  abseil-*
#    We are not using abseil.
#
#  altera-*
#    Doesn't apply.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-avoid-magic-numbers
#  readability-magic-numbers
#    Generally good advice, but there are too many places where this is
#    useful, for instance in tests.
#
#  fuchsia-*
#    Much too strict.
#
#  google-runtime-references
#    This is just a matter of preference.
#
#  llvmlibc-*
#    Not applicable.
#
#  misc-include-cleaner
#    Too many reports. Disabled for now.
#
#  readability-implicit-bool-conversion
#    I don't think this makes the code more readable.
